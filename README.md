## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learn and apply Tailwind CSS to this project as well as consolidate my React.js knowledge. It was simple yet challenging when it comes to things I haven't touched before.

Give it a try.

### Continued development

I will surely use 100% of React and Tailwind for any upcoming projects to solidify my learning everyday.
